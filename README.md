### New - 2025-06-26 -- Added support for live Streaming via the Stream Manager tab and freefactory-notify.service control.


FreeFactory is extremely useful for both casual users and professional broadcasters alike needing to convert media files. As a former Broadcast Engineer with 40 years of experience, I originally created this for inhouse use at the television station I worked for. It was written at first as a collection of BASH scripts, then converted to a TCL/TK app soon after by good friend Karl and it remained in that form for many years....

Taking advantage of the extremely powerful ffmpeg program, our aim is to make it user friendly. While ffmpeg is most likely the most flexible and powerful media conversion program in history, it is very difficult to use for most users. This program attempts to make it easy enough for the average user and powerful enough for professionals.

FreeFactory makes it extremely easy for users to share complex "Factories" with only minor modifications needed for general users. Usually only the Output Directory (and Notify Directory if using the service) needs to be changed for the imported Factory to work as intended. 

FreeFactory is a long time project that went many years without any updates. While it originally supported both ffmpeg and ffmbc it is time to retire ffmbc support as that project has not been updated in many years, just as this one had not, until now. FFmpeg also supports most everything (if not all) that FFmbc once did.

FreeFactoryQT has been rewritten completely in Python3 (replacing TCL/TK) using a QT Frontend to create and maintain conversion Factories. It now also supports direct conversion within the GUI itself, both for single files and batch processing a list of files. The background daemon (originally FreeFactoryConversion.tcl) is still in the process of being rewritten and not yet ready for Prime-Time. However, it is still 100% compatible with the new front end and does not require any TK libraries. It's pure TCL. These are completely independent programs. Neither are required for the other to work. The only thing common between them is they both use the Factories folder to build a commandline for ffmpeg. While FreeFactoryQT will also be ported to Windows eventually, the FreeFactoryConversion service most likely will remain Linux only for many reasons.

Now using Systemd, the background notification monitoring is a service instead of a simple script in rc.local. This is also now optional. The background daemon is still being rewritten at this time but the old tcl daemon still works with the new python frontend. The Freefactory-Notify.service requires inotifywait to be installed on your system.

As there is not an Installer yet, just create a folder in /opt called FreeFactory and copy all these files into it.

You need to have ffmpeg installed in /usr/bin/

For now, start it using:
```
python3 main.py
```

The modular design of FreeFactoryQT can easily allow integration of external programs such as demucs for audio stem separation and/or vocal removal for Karaoke fans. Also incorporating sox-dsd would allow for transcoding audio files to DSD, for audiophiles. 

While extremely complicated encoding command lines can far exceed default UI options, the cool thing, you can enter those unique options in the "Manual Options" and save that as a factory, so you only need to set it once, and use it forever. 
Here is an example of a very complex "Manual Options" command:
```
-c:v mpeg2video -pix_fmt yuv422p -aspect 16:9 -intra_vlc 1 -b:v 50000000 -minrate 50000000 -maxrate 50000000 -bufsize 17825792 -rc_init_occupancy 17825792 -bf 2 -non_linear_quant 1 -color_primaries bt709 -color_trc bt709 -colorspace bt709 -seq_disp_ext 1 -video_format component -color_range 1 -chroma_sample_location topleft -signal_standard 4 -dc 8 -qmin 5 -qmax 23 -g 12 -field_order tt -top 1 -flags +ildct+ilme -alternate_scan 1 -c:a pcm_s24le -ar:a 48000
```
These Manual Options would most likely never be used for home or general use, but an example for a professional broadcast playback system. More info below the screen shots.

### Setting up FreeFactory service:

This requires TCL be installed on your system until this gets ported to Python3.

Simply run the script setup-notifyservice.sh found in /opt/FreeFactory/bin/. No need to run as root. If you decide to run the service system wide, it will ask for the sudo password.

```
$ ./setup-notifyservice.sh 
üîß FreeFactory Notify Service Setup
----------------------------------
üîç Checking if the service is currently running...
‚úÖ Service is not currently running.

üìÇ Installed in USER mode

Choose an action:
1) Install/enable in USER mode
2) Install/enable in SYSTEM-WIDE mode (requires sudo)
3) Uninstall from USER mode
4) Uninstall from SYSTEM-WIDE mode
5) Quit
Selection:
```

Unless you are running the FreeFactory service for a corporate environment with multiple users, you will generally want to select USER mode.

Once setup, you can run:
```
systemctl --user start freefactory-notify
```
and
```
systemctl --user enable freefactory-notify
```
to start whenever the user logs in.

You can also start and stop the service from within the FreeFactoryQT user interface.
