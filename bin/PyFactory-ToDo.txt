X 1. Factory List Needs A-Z Sorting and should not contain the .directory in the list as well as ignore any directories that may present in the Factories folders (ie factory_backup folder)
X  2. Need to change RemoveFactory to DeleteFactory. Maybe the same for RemoveFTP.
3. Make Windows and MacOS Compatible
X 4. Still need to display License.
X 5. Still need to display About.
6. Still need to save FreeFactory.config
X 7. Cntl+c needs to break the program.
X 8. Confirm when deleting factories.
9. Check these:        add_flag("-ar", self.AudioSampleRate.currentText())
        add_flag("-ac", self.AudioChannels.currentText())
10. Add metadata to file "Created by FreeFactory by Jim Hines and Karl Swisher"

- AudioTag not being written

- Streaming tab. Multiple streams still now working correctly. It's all or none.
