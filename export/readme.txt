FreeFactory Export Folder
-------------------------
This folder is the default destination for exported factories.

• When exporting WITHOUT zip: cleaned factory files are written here, using their base
  filename. If a name exists, '-export-N' is appended.

• When exporting TO zip: a single ZIP archive is written here. Inside the archive, each
  entry uses the base filename. Duplicates get '-export-N'.

You can change the export destination at export time; this folder is just the default.
